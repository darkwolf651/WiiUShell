# What is WiiUShell?
WiiUShell is an attempt to create a total replacement for the Wii U's home menu.

# Current Features
Almost nothing! Right now WiiuShell only features an extremly basic UI using OSScreen functions, and allows the user to pick a few faux options that are currently being used to test functions. While I have a basic idea of future features of WiiUShell, features will probably drastically change as development continues.

# What are the main goals of WiiUShell?
- Finding and displaying installed titles on system (past the 300 cap currently imposed by the menu)
- Launching of the displayed titles
- Custom settings menu allowing important settings to be accessed without the DRC.
- Support for custom themes. 

# Building
WiiUShell is built using the [Wii U Toolchain](https://github.com/decaf-emu/wut) and builds as an .rpx file.
