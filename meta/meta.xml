  <long_description>Replacement menu for Wii U

This is a work in progress project. Most features are missing, and the GUI is currently designed only for the ease of testing.

Current features of this project are a simple GUI, a theme system, a debug menu for testing and the beginning of a save system to allow changed settings to persist. </long_description>
